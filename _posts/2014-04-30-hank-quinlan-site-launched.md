The [Mount Lafayette and Franconia Ridge Trail Loop](https://www.alltrails.com/trail/us/new-hampshire/mount-lafayette-and-franconia-ridge-trail-loop) is by far my favorite
hikes of all time in both Maine & New Hampshire! If you have the chance you should definitely give this one a try, I promise it will be worth it!
