The Mount Lafayette and Franconia Ridge Trail Loop is by far my favorite hike of all time in both Maine & New Hampshire! If you have the chance you should definitely give this one a try, I promise it will be worth it! If you hike this trail be sure to bring a wind breaker and an additonal layer because the tops of all three mountains (Little Haystack, Mt.Lincoln & Mt.Lafayette) in this loop can be extremely cold and windy no matter what time of year you go. I've hiked this trail three times and it's been unpredictable each time. I like to go up Little Haystack and down Lafayette because little Haystack is the shortest peak and I feel it helps to break-up the hike with a break at the peak. But I've also done the trail starting with Lafayette and that's also nice because you can take a short break at the [Greenleaf Hut](https://www.outdoors.org/lodging-camping/huts/greenleaf) which is just 1.2 miles from the Lafayette summit, here you can get a hot meal or even a beer.
