	<p>This blog was created as a collection of posts to help hikers choose and discover new trails in Maine and New Hampsire. Each trail is rated based on
	difficulty to help you further narrow your search based on your physical abilities or just what you're in the mood for on any given day! I hope this
	guide can help you in choosing your next adventure, be safe on the trail and always leave no trace!</p>
